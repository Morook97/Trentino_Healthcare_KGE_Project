Healthcare is a complex system involving many different facilities and services. In order to improve the accessibility of the system, it is crucial to have a clear organization of the system knowledge. Clarity of the system provides efficient delivery of services when people admit to the right place at the right time. 

Healthcare systems have different stages based on the course of the disease or emergency. Medical treatment or preventive care along with ongoing therapies and residential places for the elderly, disabled people, and people with special needs such as autism or drug addiction. Facilities can be either private or public which means different administrative protocols and differ by the preference of different socioeconomic situations.

Some chronic diseases require consistent check-ups and laboratories and health centers provide the needed tests for the regular care of these people. 

Emergencies are particularly a type of category in the healthcare system and the first place to admit is usually a hospital. Since Trentino is surrounded by mountains and hiking, alpinism, and skiing are common sports, these types of emergencies and injuries are common cases in the region. 

Also considering the elderly population and Trentino as a developed region, elderly care facilities such as Alzheimer's residences and senior diurnal centers play an important role in providing healthcare services to elderly people in the region. 
# Purpose
A service that lays out the complete healthcare facilities available in the Trentino region that helps the patients discover the most suitable options by covering end-to-end healthcare services based on the individual's background and health status, symptoms, complaints, and preventive medicine needs.
